        <p class="description">
            Welcome to AWT Cinnamon Traders. We specialize in providing the finest cinnamon available in Sri Lanka.
            Our business is family-owned and run by Mr. AWT Kumara, who has many years of experience in the business industry.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            Our business has two core operations: estate and factory. We grow, harvest, and process cinnamon sticks on our estates,
            while our factory handles order processing. Orders can be either sulfur-treated or non-sulfur-treated.
            If sulfur treatment is requested, we perform sulfur fumigation as well.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            We have a capacity of producing 1 ton per day during peak season, with an annual production capacity of 300 tons.
            While our primary focus is on exporting in collaboration with various exporting companies, we are also planning to expand into the local market.
            Our workforce includes approximately 30 employees across our estates and factory, which can temporarily expand based on demand.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            We take pride in knowing that our products are part of your special moments. We are here to help you find exactly what you need.
            Thank you for supporting our mission and being a part of our journey. We look forward to serving you for generations to come.
        </p>
